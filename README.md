# GPilot (alpha version)

![Usage Animation](usage.gif)

GPilot is a Visual Studio Code extension that offers AI-powered code completion. This is an alternative to GitHub Copilot that you don't have to pay for every month. You only pay for API requests to ChatGPT. You need to retrieve Open AI API key to use this extension.

I'm trying to make this extension as similar to GitHub Copilot as possible. I would be glad to have your contribution.

## Usage

Place the cursor where you want the code suggestion and run the command `GPilot: Suggest code` (or press `Ctrl+Alt+space`).

## Todo

Problems I plan to fix soon:

- No preview of suggested code before inserting
- Sometimes a suggestion in human language is inserted instead of a code suggestion, or a part of already written code is duplicated
- No warning about invalid API key or insufficient balance on Open AI account
